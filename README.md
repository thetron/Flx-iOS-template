# Flixel iOS Template

Just a stripped down source of the Canabalt flixel iOS source.  All Canabalt specific stuff has been removed (as far as I know, let me know if there's still some left..)
Currently just starts in landscape mode, and displays HelloWorld.

Hope this can help some people get started with Flixel on iPhone.
